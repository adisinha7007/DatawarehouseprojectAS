Building Bronze layer

- Analyse source system

1- Business context and ownership
Who owns the data?
What business process does it supports?
System and Data documentation
Data model and data catalogue


2-Architecture and Technology stack
How is data stored? SQl server, Oracle , AWS, Azure….. etc
What are the integration capabilities?- APIs, Kafka, File extract, Direct DB…. etc

3- Extract and Load
Incremental vs Full load?
Data scope and historical needs
What is the expected size of the extracts?
Are there any data volume limitations?
How to avoid impacting the source system’s performance?
Authentication and authorisation(tokens, SSH keys, VPN etc)


Since our analysis has been performed on big query hence there are no DDL activities done. The extract has directly been taken from csv and imported to big query.
